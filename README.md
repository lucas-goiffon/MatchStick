# MatchStick Project (Realised 12.02.19)
###### {EPITECH First Year Project}

Matchstick or "Marienbad", is the first game where I had to create an "IA" player.

## Instructions
You only have to clone and run this command:
```
make
```

## Usage
./matchstick [number1] [number2]

- **Number1** is the map's number of lines
- **Number2** is the maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn

For example:
```
./matchstick 4 5
```
